= Collection name

== Digital collection
=== Islandora collection
When you add an item to a collection in I7, that relationship is captured in the RELS-EXT (Fedora Object to Object Relationship Metadata) datastream automatically by the system:

[source,xml]
----
<rdf:RDF>
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="info:fedora/ns:15472">
    <fedora:isMemberOfCollection rdf:resource="info:fedora/ns:imgopen"/>
    <fedora-model:hasModel rdf:resource="info:fedora/islandora:sp_basic_image"/>
    <islandora:deferDerivatives>true</islandora:deferDerivatives>
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>
----

This data powers the display pointed at by arrows in the image below, without you having to include anything in your descriptive metadata:

image::rels-ext_collection.png[]

This information will be migrated to new Islandora to retain collections structure, but there it actually becomes the value of just another field in your metadata---not stored in a separate place.

In new Islandora this means the JSON LD generated for the object contains the "Member of" relationship to the parent collection.

However neither the default OAI-PMH MODS (in I7) or DC (in I7 or new) contains this internal collection information.

=== relatedItem

If you need the name of the digital collection to be output in metadata emitted from OAI-PMH:

[source,xml]
----
<titleInfo>
  <title>Host related item</title>
</titleInfo>
<relatedItem type="host" displayLabel="Digital collection">
  <titleInfo>
    <title>Open Collection</title>
  </titleInfo>
</relatedItem>
----

Results in this display in I7:

image::relatedItem_host_collection.png[]

And this OAI_DC in I7:

[source,xml]
----
<dc:title>Host related item</dc:title>
<dc:relation>Open Collection</dc:relation>
----

There is not a clear migration path for this data to the new Islandora yet. It is possible that, if you want the collection name in the records emitted from OAI-PMH, you can just configure the OAI-PMH mapping to include the `Member of` field value.

== Physical collection

This may be a general collection like "University of Whatever Special Collections" or a specific physical collection.

=== General collection

For the general collection the following is recommended:

[source,xml]
----
<location>
  <physicalLocation>University of Whatever Special Collections</physicalLocation>
</location>
----

In I7, this displays as:

image::location_physicalLocation_simple.png[]

=== Specific collection (or part of a collection) held in a larger physical collection

To display more specific information about a sub-collection or part of a collection:

[source,xml]
----
<location>
  <physicalLocation>University of Whatever Special Collections</physicalLocation>
  <holdingSimple>
    <copyInformation>
      <subLocation>Local Historic Photos Collection</subLocation>
      <shelfLocator>Section 7, Boxes 2-23</shelfLocator>
    </copyInformation>
  </holdingSimple>
</location>
----

Which displays in I7 as:
