= Metadata in the new Islandora: information for LYRASIS-hosted Islandora clients

Date: 2021-12-14; Revised: 2022-06-16

[INFO]
====
* ILegacy = your current version of Islandora. Previously branded by the Islandora Foundation as "Islandora 7"
* Islandora = the new version of Islandora. Previously branded by the Islandora Foundation as "Islandora 8", and now just being branded as "Islandora"

== Overview of the situation

Though the new Islandora (Islandora) has been presented as an "upgrade" or "new version", the truth from a metadata standpoint is that Islandora is a completely different system. footnote:[Migrating the actual digital objects from one version to the next has proven fairly straightforward, along the lines you might expect for an upgrade. Support for robust, standards-based descriptive metadata from those objects is currently lacking from the  ] The reason for this is two-fold: 

=== 1. Completely different underlying data model
ILegacy came with add-ons supporting the ingest of descriptive metadata in standard metadata formats such as MODS, MARC-XML, and Dublin Core. The metadata was stored as MODS, and could be emitted via OAI-PMH as MODS or Dublin Core. 

*Islandora out-of-the-box provides no support for ingesting and storing descriptive metadata in standard metadata formats.* Add-ons to provide that support do not yet exist.

The fundamental assumptions about how metadata works made by Drupal (the application Islandora is built on top of) are incompatible with many of the data structures, patterns, and practices used and expected in standard metadata formats (with the exception of unqualified Dublin Core). footnote:[LYRASIS Data Migration Specialist Kristina Spurgin gave a presentation on the fundamental data model difference and its implications. The https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oe0_noa-Go&t=4s[recorded presentation is on YouTube] and the slides are available https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VGBqBMDOlzVnNKLxO-n7WdeZpHPjY_LGrdwKTqeMt7Y/edit?usp=sharing[here] if you want more information on this.]

This means there are some challenging limitations in how descriptive metadata can be expressed and stored within in out-of-the-box Islandora.

[NOTE]
====
Once your descriptive metadata is mapped into Drupal data structures, those Drupal fields can be mapped to Dublin Core or MODS XML (or many other metadata formats) for publishing via OAI-PMH. However, if any granularity/complexity of your ILegacy MODS is flattened or removed in order to get it into new Islandora, it cannot be reconstituted when you map that flattened data back out to MODS again. Here's an example of what is possible using Islandora as it comes out-of-the-box:

[TIP]
====
One solution that has been proposed to mitigate against metadata loss in migrating from LYRASIS will be migrating from ILegacy to Islandora is to migrate the current ILegacy MODS record for each object into Islandora as a media file attached to each Islandora "resource node". footnote:[See https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/objects_to_resource_nodes/["From Objects to Resource Nodes: Shifting Concepts from Islandora 7 to 8"] in the Islandora documentation]

The MODS XML will be stored, but Islandora cannot do anything with it in the system. You can only view it by navigating to the media files for your object and opening the XML file. The data in that file will not be used by Islandora for display or indexing, and you may not edit the file within Islandora. If you edit the file outside Islandora and re-upload it, it has no effect on the display or indexing of the object in Islandora. If you create new objects in Islandora, they will not have associated MODS files unless you create MODS as part of an external workflow and upload it. 

Technically the MODS metadata is not thrown away because it is there as a file. In spirit, the MODS metadata is thrown out because it can't be used in the system, will not exist for new objects in the system, and thus cannot be consistently used for anything outside the system. For these reasons, it makes little sense to spend resources creating or updating MODS metadata attached to objects in Islandora, so, realistically, any MODS XML uploaded as media will become stale/outdated.

Also note that, at the present time, the community version of Islandora does not support attaching XML files as media files out of the box, so some customization work would be required in order to support this.
====

=== 2. Use of Drupal taxonomy vocabularies

In ILegacy MODs, names, subjects, and other values from controlled vocabularies were recorded as strings (possibly with associated URIs) in the MODS.

In Islandora, heavy use is made of taxonomy vocabularies footnote:["Taxonomy vocabulary" is _sort of_ the Drupal version of a simple controlled vocabulary, but it certainly does not offer all the affordances associated with real authority control as metadata folks understand it. For more details, see https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LfpU6H4qxXtnYQPFntwMNtsgtU30yzp2MxwKKAllUOc/edit?usp=sharing[this presentation].] to store names or terms that can be referenced in the descriptive metadata on of resource nodes. 

So, even without the completely different data model to contend with, a migration to the new Islandora involves extracting names/terms, ingesting them as taxonomy terms in taxonomy vocabularies, and using references to the taxonomy terms in the descriptive metadata for each node.

== What is the metadata migration path from ILegacy to Islandora?

=== What we are seeing in the community

LYRASIS Data Migration Specialist Kristina Spurgin is one of the co-conveners of the Islandora Metadata Interest Group, so we regularly hear about how institutions are handling this transition.

In general, we are seeing that institutions moving MODS metadata into Islandora:

* Carry out intensive metadata profiling projects, to gain understanding of what MODS elements have been used and how each element has been used
* Use that information to develop a Drupal content type (or content types) for recording and storing descriptive metadata.
** This involves defining and naming the fields that can be used, determining how they will display, and designing forms.
** Different institutions are doing very different things here. Some have very simple MODS and the process is fairly straightforward. Those with more complex MODS may be developing some custom solutions to support particular high-priority metadata needs, if they have the development resources to do so. Others with complex MODS, but without the resources to develop any custom solutions, must decide how to simplify and flatten the data that will migrate into new Islandora.
** Depending on their required use cases, mapping the fields of their Drupal content types to RDF and/or standard metadata formats for providing records via OAI-PMH
* Completing significant metadata remediation projects focused on:
** Preparing names/terms for extraction to taxonomy vocabularies
** Preparing other data for cleaner mapping into that institution's Islandora content types (converting various date formats to https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/[EDTF], standardizing MODS `type` attributes, etc.)
* Working with IT to develop mapping/migration procedures and ensure they are working as expected
* Carrying out the actual migration

We are seeing this process require significant resources at an individual institution for lengthy periods of time---6 months to well over a year is not uncommon. 

=== What to expect as a LYRASIS-hosted Islandora client

==== You will NOT to have to do all the steps described above!

We understand that many of our clients have opted for LYRASIS-hosting because they don't want to (or are unable to) dedicate resources to managing and maintaining a self-hosted Islandora instance. For many of you, that includes staff resources dedicated to managing metadata in Islandora.

We also recognize that, in order to keep our risks, costs, and price low, we do not give our clients the level of access to backend tools they would need to carry out the large scale metadata profiling and remediation projects described above.

__**+++<del>+++We intend to provide a migration path for our clients into the new Islandora that requires little to no effort on their part.+++</del>+++**__

This intention was predicated on finding/building support for general/common metadata patterns into Islandora, in a way that would not preclude clients from taking advantage of new functionality and tooling in the community version of Islandora.

Unfortunately, we determined that building such support does not appear to be possible. If it is possible, it would require more development resources than are available, and would result in significant deviation from the assumptions of the community version of Islandora.

==== LYRASIS is conducting ongoing, significant development work in attempt to build more robust metadata support into the new Islandora in a way that works for both our hosting infrastructure and our client needs

Because this work is **ongoing**, we cannot yet show you what anything will look like in the LYRASIS-hosted new Islandora. There is no set metadata schema that comes with the new Islandora; as I described above, most institutions are building their own custom content types.

Our current assessment is that it is unsustainable for LYRASIS to develop and maintain custom content types for each client, so we are working to develop one or more general content types that can accommodate the metadata patterns currently found in our clients' metadata.

The metadata-related questions in the Islandora Migration Assessment communication you recently received from us were intended to help us understand your needs around some specific metadata patterns.

There are some significant technical challenges in adding more complex metadata modeling to a base system (Drupal) built for blog posts and "web content management." +++<del>+++We do not yet know if it is actually realistically possible to make everything work as we hope it will, but we are doing our best.+++</del>+++

Unfortunately, we determined that it is not realistically possible to make metadata work as we hoped in new Islandora.

https://github.com/lyrasis/islandora-metadata[This entire Github repository] is devoted to transparency about what we were  attempting to build, and you are welcome to explore any and all of it. However, the functionalities described and planned have been abandoned.

==== Some MODS metadata patterns are not translateable into the new Islandora

**Examples of MODS patterns that we have determined __cannot be replicated__ in the new Islandora include:**

* the `script` and `lang` attributes associated with individual field values, and `altRepGroup` linkages. See https://github.com/lyrasis/islandora-metadata/blob/main/mods_migration/altRepGroup_script_lang.adoc[this writeup] for more details.
* structured `relatedItem` descriptions that can recursively contain other `relatedItem` descriptions. In MODS it is possible to reflect entire object hierarchies with detailed descriptions of each level, by nesting `relatedItem` elements in the XML. The Drupal field-based data model of the new Islandora does not support this type of nested relationship of undetermined depth.


**A simple example of two MODS patterns that are not supported in new Islandora out of the box, for which we are attempting to add support:**

[source,xml]
----
<titleInfo>
  <title>City News</title>
<titleInfo>
<titleInfo type="alternative" displayLabel="On weekends, title is printed on issues as">
  <title>City Express News</title>
<titleInfo>
<identifier type="wikidata-item">1234567</identifier>
----

Using out-of-the-box functionality, you can record this data as:

image::oob_title_and_identifier.png[width=250,height=358]

The simple field types available by default in Drupal (shown above) give us no way to express:

* "On weekends, title is printed on issues as: " without recording it as an actual part of our title (which it really isn't)
* That an identifier value is of a particular identifer type.footnote:[We can define a new, separate field for each possible identifier type, note type, etc., but this becomes unwieldy to maintain in content types, forms, indexing rules, data serializations, and so on.]

The development work we are doing footnote:[These screenshots are of rough initial results] is focused on building new Drupal field types that will allow us to enter data like:

image::fieldtype_proofconcept_maintitle.png[]

image::fieldtype_proofconcept_alttitle.png[]

image::fieldtype_proofconcept_identifier.png[]

With a resulting display like:

image::fieldtype_proofconcept_display.png[]

Supporting more complex field types in data entry forms and item display is fairly straightforward, however, it is proving challenging to ensure that data in these field types behaves as expected in the rest of the system, such as:

* indexing
* batch import/export support
* RDF mapping
* mapping to records for OAI-PMH harvest

__**Depending on the patterns used in your MODS and the metadata support that is technically feasible to implement, some granularity and detail from MODS may be lost in the migration process. If any of your MODS data will be lost, prior to the migration, LYRASIS will provide you with a report of this data. **__

==== Some MODS metadata will need to be modified for migration into the new Islandora

A known example of this is date metadata. MODS allowed you to record dates in multiple encoding formats (MARC, ISO-8601, EDTF), or following no standard format.

The new Islandora has fairly advanced https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/[EDTF] support, and date format options are either EDTF or none (recorded in a separate date note field, displayed as input, and not treated as a date for sorting or faceting.

Dates that can be mapped to EDTF prior to migration should be converted to EDTF. Alternate methods of modeling dates that cannot be converted to EDTF must be worked out to meet the needs of a given repository.

+++<del>+++Prior to your migration to the new Islandora, LYRASIS will prepare a mapping (where possible) of your existing date formats to EDTF. Dates that cannot be mapped to EDTF will be migrated into date note fields.+++</del>+++

**__+++<del>+++Prior to your migration, LYRASIS will provide you with reports of any of your MODS data that will be transformed/modified in the migration process, for your review.+++</del>+++__**

==== If your institution has the staff/resources and the desire to engage in pre-migration metadata remediation, we can work with you to support that

We can provide batch dumps of your MODS metadata so that you can work with it outside Islandora (legacy). If you return updated, validated MODS to us, we can batch replace it in Islandora (legacy).

We can provide a set of general metadata profiling reports extracted from your MODS metadata.

If you are interested in these services, reach out to us via a Zendesk ticket.

If you need additional assistance with metadata remediation while in Islandora (legacy), please ask us about your project via a Zendesk ticket. Depending on the scope/complexity, we may be able to assist you under your service hours, or we may need to treat it as a new project for an additional fee. 

==== Consider getting involved in the Islandora community if you are committed to moving into the new Islandora

Open source software is created and maintained via community involvement.

Becoming involved in the Islandora community is the most powerful way to influence the direction of the application.

While LYRASIS staff has actively participated in the Islandora community in an attempt to represent the needs and perspectives of our clients, the voices of actual Islandora users carry so much more weight than ours.

Becoming involved in the community is also a great way to learn more about the new Islandora.

https://github.com/Islandora/islandora-community/wiki[This page] lists various ways you can connect with the community (including mailing lists and Slack), as well as links out to the User calls and Tech/Development calls that occur regularly.
