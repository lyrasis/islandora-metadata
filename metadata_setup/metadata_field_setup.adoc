== Entity reference fields linking to taxonomy terms

=== To accept all terms from one or more vocabularies

Here we are configuring `field_abstract` on the `lyrasis_repository_item` content type. This field has field type: Typed Text (plain, long).

Specifically, we are interested in what terms can be used as abstract types.

If we want to allow all terms from the Abstract Type vocabulary, including deprecated terms, then:

* Reference method: Default
* Vocabulary: Abstract Type

If you wanted to accept all terms from multiple vocabularies, you would check all vocabularies that apply.

=== To accept only active (non-deprecated) terms from one or more vocabularies

There is an Entity Reference Source View named `Active taxonomy terms` (machine name: `taxonomy_terms_active`).

This view limits the terms that are available to populate a field to (1) terms that are published; and (2) terms where the `Term Deprecated?` field value is `No`.

This view is not constrained to a particular vocabulary, but will only provide results from vocabularies having a `Term Deprecated?` field defined for its terms.

This view has a contextual filter configured using vocabulary. If no vocabulary(-ies) are specified in the field definition, all terms from all eligible vocabularies will be in the list.

To show only active terms from the Abstract Type vocabulary:

* Reference method: Views: Filter by an entity reference view
* View used to select the entities: taxonomy_terms_active - Entity Reference
* View arguments: abstract_types 

`abstract_types` is the machine name for the Abstract Type vocabulary

If you wanted to allow all active terms from more than one vocabulary, you need to specify all the vocabularies (by machine name) in `View arguments`, separated by `+`:

`abstract_types+identifier_types`
