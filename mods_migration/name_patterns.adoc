= MODS name pattern examples

toc::[]

Here I'm trying to identify known patterns of data within the `name` element, and clarify how those patterns should be handled in migration.

I'm also noting non-standard patterns that should maybe be bounced back to clients for clarification/fix up.

As of this writing, note that I don't have any data on the frequency of any of these patterns. They have been identifed in the manual process of spot checking things. 

== Normal patterns

== Non-standard patterns

=== `name/role/roleTerm` has terminal period

==== Example(s)

.client12:214060 
[source,xml]
----
<name type="personal" authority="naf">
    <namePart>Patnode, E.</namePart>
    <role>
        <roleTerm type="text">author.</roleTerm>
    </role>
</name>
<name type="personal" authority="naf">
    <namePart>DeZeeuw, Dick</namePart>
    <role>
        <roleTerm type="text">author.</roleTerm>
    </role>
</name>
<name type="corporate" authority="naf">
    <namePart>Oregon</namePart>
    <namePart>Dry Cleaner Program,</namePart>
    <role>
        <roleTerm type="text">issuing body.</roleTerm>
    </role>
</name>
----    

==== Possible treatment/algorithm

* strip terminal period from `roleTerm` element before mapping/matching to Agent role taxonomy

==== Results

* client12:214060 -> `author; issuing body`
