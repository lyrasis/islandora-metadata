= LYRASIS (new) Islandora metadata documentation

[IMPORTANT]
====
Due to (1) underlying assumptions/limitations in the Drupal data model, and (2) the ways in which new Islandora interacts with and relies upon that Drupal data model, our work toward better supporting common metadata patterns in order to build a general content model that could work for all clients concluded that this goal is not feasible. If possible at all, it would require development resources not currently available, and diverge significantly from the community Islandora in a manner we feel is unsustainable.

This project has been abandoned.

The specifications and other information will be left in place as a record of what we were trying to accomplish, in case anyone finds it useful or informative.
