== About the `label` property

Is always a short plain text type.

This property supports the metadata pattern of providing identifying or contextualizing information for data recorded in a field, primarily for public display.

Examples of support for this pattern in several metadata schema: 

- http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/userguide/attributes.html#displayLabel[MODS displayLabel attribute]
- https://folgerpedia.folger.edu/MARC_%C7%823_Materials_specified[MARC subfield 3 (Materials specified)]
- https://www.loc.gov/ead/EAD3taglib/EAD3.html#attr-label[EAD label attribute]

There are use cases where such a label should be displayed as the main label of the field in which it is used.

There are other use cases where such a label should be prepended to and visually distinguished from a value in a field, but where the main/default label for the field should be retained.
