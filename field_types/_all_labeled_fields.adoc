= Field types: Stuff shared by all field types having `label` property

toc::[]

== About the `label` property

Is always a short plain text type.

This property supports the metadata pattern of providing identifying or contextualizing information for data recorded in a field, primarily for public display.

Examples of support for this general pattern in several metadata schema: 

- http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/userguide/attributes.html#displayLabel[MODS displayLabel attribute]
- https://folgerpedia.folger.edu/MARC_%C7%823_Materials_specified[MARC subfield 3 (Materials specified)]
- https://www.loc.gov/ead/EAD3taglib/EAD3.html#attr-label[EAD label attribute]

There are use cases where such a label should be displayed as the main label of the field in which it is used (Example 1 below).

There are other use cases where such a label should be prepended to and visually distinguished from a value in a field, but where the main/default label for the field should be retained. (Example 2 below).

Example 2 also shows the expectation of `type` being able to generate appropriate field label for display.

One can imagine a case where an institution wanted to be able to search its "Digitization Process" notes separately from other notes about physical description footnote:[In which case an argument can be made for defining a new field instance `field_digitization_process` might make more sense. But some institutions have made extremely liberal use of displayLabels, which could lead to large numbers of fields to manage.]. One way to do this would be to include the label in the indexed value and train users to include the label in the search. The effectiveness of this approach probably depends on how well the data is structured and the overall content in these notes. Another way would be to map the values to a separate Solr field. This approach would be required to support faceting, as might be useful with Example 3 below, to be able to limit to native plants in a collection.

I think most institutions are content to have all alternative titles simply indexed as titles, regardless of the displayLabel values. However including the display label value in the indexed value would throw off retrieval and relevance ranking, so is probably a bad idea.

<physicalDescription>
  <note>
    Artificial penumothorax apparatus with wood base and back. Two blocks of wood hold a framework of steel tubes, to which are attached nozzles, a barometer, hoses, and tubes connecting two large glass vessels with pressurized caps. Each glass vessel has markings of capacity from 0 to 2000cc, and has a valve at the top which is connected to the gauge and other bottle with a tightly clamping handle. Connecting hoses are made of rubber. The gauge on the left hand side of the apparatus reads from 22 at the top and bottom to Zero at the middle of the gauge mechanism. Tubes are made of rubber.

== Display formatter

* For fields that have both `type` and `label` properties see https://github.com/lyrasis/islandora8-metadata/blob/main/field_types/all_typed_and_labeled_fields.adoc[Field types: Stuff shared by all field types having both `type` and `label` properties]
* If field has `label` property, but no `type` property, include the display formatter options as described in https://github.com/lyrasis/islandora8-metadata/blob/main/field_types/all_typed_and_labeled_fields.adoc[Field types: Stuff shared by all field types having both `type` and `label` properties], with the following modifications to the available values:
** Field label source:
*** Field name
*** Label value
** Field value label source:
*** Label value
*** none

== Indexing

- For fields that have both `type` and `label` properties see https://github.com/lyrasis/islandora8-metadata/blob/main/field_types/all_typed_and_labeled_fields.adoc[Field types: Stuff shared by all field types having both `type` and `label` properties]

- If field has `label` property, but no `type` property, include only the `Index under field + label` and `Include field value label in indexed value?` options as described in https://github.com/lyrasis/islandora8-metadata/blob/main/field_types/all_typed_and_labeled_fields.adoc[Field types: Stuff shared by all field types having both `type` and `label` properties]
